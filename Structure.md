# Overall Structure:
- The `parameters.gama` file specificies universal constants and simulation parameters
- The `Agents.gama` file specifies simulation species and their behaviors.
- The `clustering.gama` file specifies the initialization state, as well as the different experiments to be run and a few global functions

## Agents:

### Poeple:
The people agents are designed with a Finite State Machine control system. The FSM dictates the sequence of actions to take when a person decides to travel to a new location.


### Bikes:
Bikes are similarly designed with a Finite State Machine control system.
